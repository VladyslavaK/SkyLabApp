        <li>Low pressure</li>
        <li>Dust storms</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All these factors make process of growing plants on the Red Planet tremendously hard. Nevertheless, humanity still has a chance to grow fresh vegetables and plants inside of cosmic stations by using hydroponic farms. The SkyLab App is created for
        inteligent managment of a hydro-farm, no matter of it`s size and planet independently. </p>
    <h4>The main advantages of SkyLab:</h4>
    <ul class="bg-success">
        <li>ability to revise your plants cells timeline characteristic</li>
        <li>adding and assigning available sensors to cell</li>
